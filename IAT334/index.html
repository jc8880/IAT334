        <p>Our Domain: A design to help with daily user welfare & wellness</p>
        <p>Initial Research</p>
<p>The wellness industry has been growing in the past few years. This can be attributed to the fact that “the distinction between work and everything else, already a blurry line for most Americans, got even blurrier” (Wortham, 2021). Some of the people within this domain would be users that are experiencing a variety of concerns or anxieties about their health (Radial Group, N.D.). Users often feel dissatisfaction in their life and the wellness apps would be a strategy to make a small change. Depending on the health concerns faced, the audience could be both men and women (Radial Group, N.D.), however it can be inferred that due to the motivation for use being health problems/concerns, the audience would be generally older. </p>

<p>Based on the existing market of wellness apps, calmness and sleep are very common goals that could be improved or solved (Wylie, 2023). Additionally, routines and systematic ways of living are methods that these apps seem to use in order to establish a commitment for their user to feel like they get something meaningful out of the app. These apps use technologies such as pattern recognition to identify user trends, logic to determine which user choices lead to which results, and visuals to convey a sense of calmness (Wylie, 2023). For example, referring to the app Calm, “even the mere act of tapping Calm open has a narcotic effect” (Wortham, 2021).</p>

<p>Jenna Wortham also notes that “wellness has become synonymous with productivity and self-optimization” (2021). While downloading an app may not be able to solve all health related problems, it can offer opportunities for users, specifically seniors, to become better involved in making progress towards a personal goal. Towards the later stages of our lives, productivity may feel increasingly important as we physically cannot do as much as we once did, but still require mental engagement.</p>
