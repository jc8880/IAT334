            <li class = researchPoints>Based on the existing market of wellness apps, <strong class = accentColour>calmness and sleep are very common goals</strong> that could be improved or solved</li>

          <p class = subText>Why do we need this application? What makes it different from our competitors?</p>
          <p>Early Riser is designed to be easy to navigate and use for the elderly and older audiences. What makes this application unique and different from our competitors is that it promotes productivity with our unique feature called guided activities, a compilation of videos on relaxing activities that the users can browse.</p>
          <p>The application also offer flexible scheduling and allows the user to customize their own "to-do" list. Futhermore through this application intermingling these two features, we hope to eliminate boredom and introduce the elderly users to the new activities that will help them start their day.</p>
          <p>Instead of the simple "to-do" list application, Early Riser specifically revolves around being an application that users would want to open as soon as they wake up.</p>

        <h3 class = heading3> Intended User</h3>
        <p>Based on our earlier research for this application design, our intended users would be seniors and older adults looking for ways to improve and maintain their ways of life as they get older.</p>
        <p>This application would addresses their boredom and offers them something to look forward to each day</p>
        <p>This application would also preserve their sense of personal productivity, especially as seniors begin to have less work and more free time; “wellness has become synonymous with productivity and self-optimization” (Jenna Wortham, 2021).</p>
        <p>Finally, this application is meant to be elderly friendly to accommodate users who may not be as familiar with navigating technology and prevent senior frustrations.</p>

          <p class = "subText secondaryColour">OUR PLAN</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Prepare what tasks the participants would do in the application.</li>
            <li>Allow the participants to go through the application.</li>
            <li>Prepare the usability testing questionnaire.</li>
            <li>Interview the participants regarding the application.</li>

        </div>
        <div class = "flexItem boxBackground">
          <p class = "subText backgroundColour">OUR METHODS</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We would allow the participants to use the application uninterrupted for the specified time or until they complete the task</li>
            <li>We would take notes of how they were approaching the completion of our assigned tasks and any other usability problems</li>
            <li>Besides taking notes and assisting when they are struggling with some tasks, we otherwise allow the user to experience the application independently</li>

        <div class = "flexItem boxBackground">
          <p class = "subText">USER TASKS</p>
          <p>A few pre-determined tasks were chosen each time, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Add a reminder for ‘lunch’ to your daily reminders list”</li>
            <li>“Find and watch a video that most interests you”</li>
            <li>“Sign out of the app when you’re done for the day”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "flexItem boxBackground">
          <p class = "subText secondaryColour">QUESTIONS</p>
          <p>Examples of some questions we asked the participants, with common replies</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How did you feel when looking at the app’s visuals? What emotions did it evoke?</li>
            <p>Organized, cheery, easy to read</p>
            <li>What feature do you think you would most likely want to use on a daily basis? Why?</li>
            <p>Reminders page is most likely, as you can visualize your schedule without needing to have a good memory. Bold colors also help to easily recognize different reminders.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = "flexItem boxBackground">
          <p class = "subText backgroundColour">VIDEO TESTING</p>
          <p>We experienced some struggles while gathering data due to the video communication environment, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Getting Protopie to cooperate with the user proved to be a difficult process with them needing to download the app and having to sign in using our account in order to access the project.</li>
            <li>Having to translate to our senior members who are not proficient in english</li>
            <p>This user test experience could affect their impression of the application negatively and thus result in a bias of opinions </p>
          </ul>

      <div class = extraPadding></div>
      <div class = centerAlign>
        <h3 class = heading3>Based on Our User Testing Feedback, we focused on a few main revisions</h3>
          <p><strong>DESIGN ISSUE 1 (progress bar):</strong></p>
          <p>The design of the progress bar too closely resembled the interactable buttons</p>
          <p>To improve, the progress bar was revised with additional feedback such as text to indicate what it is progressing towards, clarifying its purpose to the user</p>
          <p><strong>DESIGN ISSUE 2 (Reminders time selector button):</strong></p>
          <p>Considering the context of use being on a mobile phone rather than desktop, we needed to enlarge the text area to better match with the common surface area of a finger</p>
          <p><strong>DESIGN ISSUE 3 (Lack of Customization):</strong></p>
          <p>Our feedback indicated the need to design a way for the user to add new entries to the list of activities they could choose from</p>
          <p>To improve the functionality of the application, we considered how we could allow these new entries to interact with the overall timeline of the "to-do" reminder page</p>
