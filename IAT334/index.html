            <li class = researchPoints>Based on the existing market of wellness apps, <strong class = accentColour>calmness and sleep are very common goals</strong> that could be improved or solved</li>

          <p class = subText>Why do we need this application? What makes it different from our competitors?</p>
          <p>Early Riser is designed to be easy to use and navigate for the elderly and older users. What makes this application unique and different from our competitor is that it promotes productivity with our unique feature called 
           guided activities, which is a compilation of videos on relaxing activities that the users could use.</p>
          <p>The application also offer flexible scheduling and also allow the user to customized their own to-do list. Futhermore through this application intermingling of these two feature, we hope to eliminate boredom and introduce the elderly users 
           to the new activities that will help them start their day.</p>
          <p>Instead of the simple to-do list application, our application specifically revolves around being as application that users would want to open as soon as they wake up.</p>

        <h2 class = subTitle>Interaction Framework</h2>
        <p class = subText> Our Intended User</p>
        <p>Base on our earlier research for this application design, our intended users would be seniors and older adults looking for ways to improve and maintain their ways of life as they get older.</p>
        <p>This application would addresses their boredom and offers them something to look forward to each day</p>
        <p>This application would also preserve their sense of personal productivity, especially as seniors begin to have less work/jobs and more free time “Wellness has become synonymous with productivity and self-optimization” (Wortham, 2021).</p>
        <p>Finally, this application is meant to be elderly friendly to accommodate users who may not be as familiar with navigating technology and prevent senior frustrations.</p>

    </section>


    <section id = "testing" class = sectionB>
      <h2 class = subTitle>User testing</h2>
 <p class = subText>Our Plan</p>
 <p>Prepare what tasks the participants would do in the application.</p>
 <p>Allow the participants to go through the application.</p>
 <p>Prepare the usability testing questionnaire.</p>
 <p>Interview the participants regarding the application.</p>

 <p class = subText>Our Methods</p>
 <p>We would allow the participants to use the application uninterrupted for the specified time or until they complete the task</p>
 <p>We would take notes of how they were approaching the completion of our assigned tasks and any other usability problems</p>
 <p>We also would be taking notes and help them when they are struggling with some tasks but otherwise allow the user to experience the application</p>

 <p class = subText>Tasks </p>
 <p>A few pre-determined tasks were chosen each time, for example:</p>
 <p>“Add a reminder for ‘lunch’ to your daily reminders list”</p>
 <p>Helps us determine if the main app feature is clear to understand</p>
 <p>“Find and watch a video that most interests you”</p>
 <p>Testing how the user navigates “guided activities” to find their personal interests</p>
 <p>“Sign out of the app when you’re done for the day”</p>
 <p>Interacting with an important, but less frequently occurring feature</p>

 <p class = subText>Questions</p>
 <p>Examples of some questions we asked the participants, with common replies</p>
 <p>How did you feel when looking at the app’s visuals? What emotions did it evoke?</p>
 <p>Organized, cheery, easy to read</p>
 <p>What feature do you think you would most likely want to use on a daily basis? Why?</p>
 <p>Reminders page is most likely, as you can visualize your schedule without needing to have a good memory.</p>
 <p>Bold colors also help to easily recognize different reminders</p>



 <p class = subText>Problems over video user testing:</p>

 <p>Getting Protopie to cooperate with the user is proving to be a difficult process with them needing to download the app and having to sign in using our account in order to access the project.</p>

 <p>Having to translate to our senior members who are not proficient in english</p>

 <p>This experience could affect the impression of the application negatively and thus result in a bias of opinions </p>

 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 1:
The progress bar featured at the bottom of the app’s main path is not clearly identified as one, it is too ambiguous</p>


 <p class = subText>WHY?:</p> 
 <p>Mistaken interpretation, user mental model did not align with our intended perception</p>

 <p>Our user attempted to click on it and hover around the area to see if anything additional occurred</p>
 <p>commented on being unsure what it represented.</p>

 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 2:</p>
 <p>The time selector that indicates where on the timeline to place the reminder is too small for the users</p>


 <p class = subText>WHY?: </p>
 <p>The interaction requires more precision and control which may not be ideal for all users, especially seniors</p>

 <p>Our user noted that if it was larger, they would feel better about having to use the feature</p>


 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 3:</p>
 <p>The lack of interaction and customization with each individual reminder entry</p>


 <p class = subText>WHY?: </p>
 <p>Users feel that it should be more personalized for them; the lack of customization is a concern towards catering to experienced audiences</p>

 <p>The current interface of the reminders page cannot easily accommodate an extra section for user interaction and requires a redesign</p>

 <p class = subText>Design consideration</p>

 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 1 (progress bar):</p>
 <p>The design of the progress bar too closely resembles the interactable buttons</p>
 <p>To improve, the progress bar could use additional feedback such as text to indicate what it is progressing towards, clarifying its purpose to the user</p>

 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 2 (Reminders time selector button):</p>
 <p>Considering the context of use being on a mobile phone rather than desktop, we need to enlarge the text area to better match with the common surface area of a finger</p>

 <p class = subText>DESIGN ISSUE 3 (Lack of Customization):</p>
 <p>We should design a way for the user to add new entries to the list of activities they could choose from</p>

 <p>To improve the functionality of the application, we should consider how we could allow these new entries to interact with the overall timeline of the to-do reminder page</p>
