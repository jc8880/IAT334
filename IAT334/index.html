      <p class = subText> Our Intended User</p>
      <p>Base on our earlier research for this application design, our intended users would be seniors and older adults looking for ways to improve and maintain their ways of life as they get older.</p>
      <p>This application would addresses their boredom and offers them something to look forward to each day</p>
      <p>This application would also preserve their sense of personal productivity, especially as seniors begin to have less work/jobs and more free time “Wellness has become synonymous with productivity and self-optimization” (Wortham, 2021).</p>
      <p>Finally, this application is meant to be elderly friendly to accommodate users who may not be as familiar with navigating technology and prevent senior frustrations.</p>
